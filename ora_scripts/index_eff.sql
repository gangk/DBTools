rem     Notes
rem     Example of analyzing index entries per leaf block.
rem
rem     Set up the schema, table name, and index name before
rem     running the query.
rem
rem     The code assumes you have no more than 10 columns in
rem     the index for the purposes of generating "is not null"
rem     clauses to force the necessary index-only execution path.
rem     This limit can easily be extended by cloning and editing
rem     the lines of the "setup" statement.
rem
rem     For a simple b-tree index, the first parameter to the
rem     sys_op_lbid() function has to be the object_id of the
rem     index.
rem
rem     The query will work with a sample clause if you are
rem     worried that the index you want to investigate is too
rem     large to analyze in a reasonable time. (I take 100 blocks
rem     per second as a conservative estimate for the I/O rate
rem     when running this script on very large indexes but have
rem     seen it running three or four times faster that.)
rem
rem     This version of the code is suitable only for simple
rem     B-tree indexes - although that index may be reversed,
rem     have descending columns or virtual (function-based)
rem     columns, or be a global index on a partitioned table.
